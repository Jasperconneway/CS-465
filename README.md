**Architecture**

The types of frontend development used in my full stack project have similarities and differences. The Travlr Getaways web application began as a static web application that we made dynamic. We used Express 
HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA) to create the client-side and admin side for the Travlr Getaways web application. Express is a framework using Node.js that allows us to create a dynamic 
web application for trips from the MongoDB database. JavaScript was used to create our interactive user interface, form validation, and update trips for customers. Alongside express, handlebars were used to 
render HTML on the server by binding the data to templates. This allowed us to decrease the amount of code we created.

For SPA, we used Angular to load a single HTML page. SPA uses client-side rendering to update the admin side dynamically. This allows the page to be fast and provide seamless user experiences. The only downside 
is the initial load which takes longer to complete. The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database for many benefits. This allows for scalability, flexibility, performance, and availability. It is known to manage 
large amounts of data and does not rely on schema.


**Functionality**

While JSON and JavaScript both handle data in the web application, they have significant differences. JSON structures the data using key/value pairs, storing and exchanging this data to communicate across the 
web application. This makes it more simple and flexible for JavaScript to easily manipulate the data. While JSON formats data, it is not a programming language like JavaScript. 

There were instances in the full stack process where we refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies. One such instance was when we refactored static HTML pages using Handlebars. Specifically, these 
were the headers and footers of the web application which decreased the amount of repetitive code and condensed the file of code.


**Testing**

There were multiple cases throughout the full stack application project that testing was conducted. Throughout the code, we sent error codes to the console that would help determine if there was an issue in the 
web application. These error codes would inform us what went wrong, and any log message told us how or where within the code it went wrong. Endpoints define URL structures that a client will use to access the 
API. These endpoints use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. Security is important because each user must be authenticated before allowing them access to unauthorized information within the web application. 


**Reflection**

This course has helped me in reaching my professional goals by introducing me to web development. This course is the first where I developed code to create a functioning web application. It introduced multiple 
terms within this realm that I didn’t know before and provided me with the knowledge I can take to interviews in the future. While I cannot say I’ve mastered web applications, I can take this firsthand 
experience to prospective jobs in the future.
